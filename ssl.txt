First, make sure that you have key.pem and cert.pem files. You can generate them using this command:

openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
This generates a cert-key pair and it will be valid for roughly 10 years (3650 days to be exact).

Then you need to run the server with -S for enabling SSL and -C for your certificate file:

$ http-server -S -C cert.pem -o
